| 3-4.9 | Missing multiple essential slides; flow poor but still somewhat recoverable |
| 0-2.9 | Missing most essential slides; structure is chaotic and very hard to follow |

---

## 3. Storytelling (20%)

**Focus:** Whether the sequence and framing create understanding and momentum

### Narrative Arc

The deck should follow: Context → Problem → Insight → Solution → Proof → Ask

| Element | What it does |
|---------|--------------|

| 7-8.9 | Strong story; good flow; engaging |
| 5-6.9 | Acceptable story; some flow issues; holds attention |
| 3-4.9 | Weak story; poor flow; disjointed |
| 0-2.9 | No coherent story; chaotic; confusing |

---

## 4. Design & Visual Clarity (10%)

**Focus:** Is the deck professional, legible, and visually clear?

### Design Principles: Legible, Simple, Obvious

**Legible:**
- ✅ Font size 20+ is ideal; occasional smaller text in charts/tables is acceptable if still legible
- ✅ Simple, readable font choice
- ✅ Good contrast with background
- ✅ High quality images (not pixelated)
- ❌ Small fonts requiring zoom
- ❌ Poor contrast (light text on light background)
- ❌ Low quality or stretched images

**Simple:**
- ✅ One idea per slide
- ✅ <50 words per slide is ideal; occasional denser slides (financials, roadmap) are acceptable if clearly structured
- ✅ Slide titles convey key takeaway (not generic like "The Problem")
- ✅ Important information at top of slide
- ✅ Good use of whitespace
- ❌ Cluttered slides with multiple ideas
- ❌ Text-heavy (100+ words per slide)
- ❌ Generic titles that don't communicate message

**Obvious:**
- ✅ Charts understandable at first glance
- ✅ Clear labels and legends
- ✅ Visual hierarchy guides the eye
- ✅ Key points immediately visible
- ❌ Confusing or unclear charts
- ❌ Too much data on one chart
- ❌ Reader has to search for key information

**Consistent & Professional:**
- ✅ Consistent color palette
- ✅ Consistent text sizing and formatting
- ✅ Consistent logo placement
- ✅ Page numbers (bottom right recommended)
- ✅ Professional appearance overall
- ❌ Inconsistent fonts, colors, or formatting
- ❌ Amateur or unprofessional appearance

### Scoring Bands

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Excellent design; highly professional; effortless to read; strong visual hierarchy |
| 7-8.9 | Good design; mostly clear and professional; minor issues |
| 5-6.9 | Acceptable design; some cluttered slides or inconsistencies |
| 3-4.9 | Poor design; text-heavy; unclear visuals; unprofessional |
| 0-2.9 | Very poor design; severely impacts readability |

---

## 5. Spelling & Grammar (5%)

**Focus:** Is language professional and error-free?

### Evaluation Criteria

- ✅ No spelling errors
- ✅ No grammatical mistakes
- ✅ Professional language throughout
- ✅ Consistent terminology
- ✅ No math errors in charts/numbers
- ❌ Typos or spelling errors
- ❌ Grammatical mistakes
- ❌ Inconsistent terminology
- ❌ Math errors or inconsistent numbers (only flag if obvious within the deck, e.g., sum of components doesn't equal total on same slide)

### Scoring Bands

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | No errors; highly professional language |
| 7-8.9 | 1-2 minor errors; generally professional |
| 5-6.9 | Several errors; acceptable but noticeable |
| 3-4.9 | Many errors; unprofessional impression |
| 0-2.9 | Pervasive errors; severely impacts credibility |

---

## 6. Deck Length (2%)

**Focus:** Is slide count appropriate?

### Scoring Formula

| Slide Count | Score | Rationale |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| 10-20 slides | 10 | Ideal range |
| 8-9 slides | 8-9 | Slightly too concise; likely missing content |
| 21-25 slides | 7-8 | Slightly long |
| 26-30 slides | 5-7 | Too long; attention span issues |
| 31+ slides | 2-5 | Way too long |
| <8 slides | 4-6 | Missing critical content |

---

## Deck Score Calculation

\`\`\`
Deck Score = (Content Clarity × 0.35) + (Structure × 0.28) + (Storytelling × 0.20) + (Design × 0.10) + (Spelling × 0.05) + (Length × 0.02)
\`\`\`

---

## First Impression Analysis (Slides 1-3)

Investors decide in the first 3 minutes whether to continue or pass.

**Evaluate:**
- Does slide 1 or 2 clearly state what the company does?
- Do slides 1-3 create urgency and interest?
- Is the problem/solution immediately clear?
- Are there any immediate red flags?

**Output:**
- Verdict: CONTINUE or PASS
- Reasoning: Why investor would continue or pass

---

## Score Capping Rules

| If missing from deck... | Category | Cap at |
|-------------------------|----------|--------|
| Title slide with company description | Content Clarity | 6 |
| Problem slide | Content Clarity | 5 |
| Solution slide | Content Clarity | 5 |
| Ask slide | Structure | 6 |
| Two or more essential slide types for the stage | Overall Deck Score | 5 |

---

## Critical Accuracy Requirements

- ONLY flag something as "missing" if genuinely absent from deck
- VERIFY before stating timelines, metrics, or details are missing
- Ground ALL criticism in what is actually missing, not what could be better
- Be direct and honest, but factually accurate
`;

export const questionGenRubric = `# Investor Question Generation Framework

## Overview

Generate exactly 5 questions investors will likely ask, based on:

1. **Gaps in the deck** — Missing slides or information
2. **Unclear communication** — Points requiring clarification
3. **Claims requiring validation** — Statements without evidence
4. **Criteria scored Low (0-4)** — Weak areas in startup assessment
5. **Criteria unassessable from deck** — Important factors requiring conversation

---

## Question Selection Logic

### Priority Order

Select questions in this priority order until you have 5:

1. **Critical gaps** — Essential information missing for the stage
2. **Low-scoring criteria** — Areas scoring 0-4 in startup assessment
3. **Unvalidated claims** — Bold statements without evidence
4. **Unclear communication** — Key points that need clarification
5. **Unassessable criteria** — Important factors that can't be evaluated from a deck

When choosing between multiple possible questions at the same priority level, prefer questions where the answer would meaningfully change an investor's decision, conviction, or valuation over "nice to know" detail.

### Stage Calibration

For earlier or low-data companies within a stage, prefer question variants that ask "how are you thinking about X?" rather than presuming a fully mature metric.

Stage-appropriate expectations:
- **Pre-Seed:** Focus on founder insight, problem validation, early customer signals
- **Seed:** Focus on traction quality, retention signals, GTM motion emergence
- **Series A:** Focus on scalability, unit economics, path to Series B

---

## Distribution Guidelines

- Aim for coverage across categories; avoid 3+ questions from the same area unless gaps are severe
- Before finalising the 5 questions, check for overlap and remove or merge questions that ask essentially the same thing
- Don't ask Series A questions of Pre-Seed companies

---

## Unassessable Criteria

These cannot be evaluated from a deck and should be drawn from if other triggers don't fill 5 questions:

| Criterion | What it probes |
|-----------|----------------|
| Founder resilience | How they handle adversity and setbacks |
| Team dynamics | Decision-making process and co-founder relationship |
| Learning velocity | How quickly they iterate based on feedback |
| Customer depth | Quality and depth of customer relationships |
| Sales capability | Actual sales process and loss analysis |
| Reference quality | Which customers would vouch for them |
| Coachability | How they respond to investor feedback |
| Hiring & team building | Quality and process of recent hires |
| Org health | Attrition, culture, team morale |
| GTM execution | Actual sales process beyond what's presented |
| Retention quality | Which customers are at risk and why |

Generate questions dynamically based on these themes rather than using fixed question text.

---

## Question Quality Standards

Good questions are:
- **Specific** — Reference actual content from the deck
- **Decision-relevant** — The answer would change investment conviction
- **Open-ended** — Invite narrative response, not yes/no
- **Stage-appropriate** — Calibrated to reasonable expectations for the stage

Avoid:
- Questions already answered in the deck
- Leading questions that assume a problem
- Multiple questions bundled into one
- Generic questions that could apply to any startup
`;

export const feedbackRubric = `# Written Feedback Framework

## Overview

Provide written feedback on both:

1. **Deck Feedback** — How well the pitch deck communicates
2. **Startup Feedback** — How strong the underlying business appears

Feedback should be direct, specific, actionable, and stage-appropriate.

---

## Deck Feedback

Evaluates the pitch deck as a communication vehicle—clarity, structure, flow, and persuasiveness—independent of the underlying business quality.

### Structure

| Component | Length | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Executive Summary | 2-3 sentences | Overall deck quality and key takeaway |
| Strengths | 2-3 items | What the deck does well |
| Weaknesses | 2-3 items | What needs improvement (with severity) |
| Priority Actions | 2-3 items | Most important changes to make |

### Output Format

**Executive Summary:** Provide an overall assessment, the biggest strength, and the biggest gap or opportunity.

**Strengths:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Short descriptor",
  "description": "Specific explanation with evidence from deck"
}
\`\`\`

**Weaknesses:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Short descriptor",
  "description": "Specific explanation of the issue and its impact",
  "severity": "critical | high | medium"
}
\`\`\`

**Priority Actions:** Numbered list of 2-3 specific, actionable changes, ordered by impact.

---

## Startup Feedback

Evaluates the underlying business based on what can be assessed from the deck—team, market, traction, product, defensibility, and fundability.

### Structure

| Component | Length | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Executive Summary | 2-3 sentences | Overall startup quality and investment readiness |
| Strengths | 2-3 items | What's compelling about this business |
| Concerns | 2-3 items | Key risks or gaps (with severity) |

### Output Format

**Executive Summary:** Provide an overall investment readiness assessment, the most compelling element, and the biggest question or risk. If scores are polarized (e.g., strong team but weak traction), call out the trade-off explicitly.

**Strengths:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Short descriptor",
  "description": "Specific explanation with evidence from deck"
}
\`\`\`

**Concerns:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Short descriptor",
  "description": "Specific explanation of the risk and why it matters",
  "severity": "critical | high | medium"
}
\`\`\`

---

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Critical | Likely a deal-breaker for most investors at this stage; fix before sending any decks |
| High | Significant concern that weakens the deck/business; must be addressed |
| Medium | Notable issue but not fatal; improve when possible |

---

## Stage Calibration

Calibrate all feedback to the appropriate stage. What constitutes a concern at Series A may be entirely normal at Pre-Seed.

- **Pre-Seed:** Traction may be user interviews, pilots, or waitlists rather than revenue. Focus on clarity, honesty, and evidence of customer discovery.
- **Seed:** Expect paying customers, early retention signals, and emerging GTM motion. Push harder on metrics and repeatability.
- **Series A:** Expect fully formed traction, unit economics, proven GTM, and clear path to next stage.

---

## Key Distinctions

- **Deck vs. Startup feedback:** Deck feedback evaluates communication and presentation. Startup feedback evaluates the underlying business. Keep these separate—a startup concern should be about business risk, not slide design.
- **Priority actions flow from weaknesses:** The actions should directly address the weaknesses identified, ordered by impact.
- **Flag exceptional performance:** If something is genuinely exceptional for the stage (e.g., ARR, retention, founder track record), explicitly call it out so founders understand they're ahead of typical benchmarks.

---

## Tone Principles

- Be direct and honest
- Be specific—reference actual slides, metrics, or content
- Be constructive—don't just identify problems, give direction
- Acknowledge uncertainty—don't claim to know things that can't be assessed from a deck

---

## Team (28%)

### Founder-Market Fit & Insight (12%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do the founders have lived experience with this problem or buyer?
- Do they hold a non-obvious insight that changes how this market should work?
- Do they have an unfair advantage in this problem?
- Are they credible in the eyes of the customers they're targeting?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No clear link to the market or problem. Insight feels generic or second-hand. No articulated "why us." Can't clearly articulate why incumbents haven't solved this already. | Some relevant experience (worked in adjacent roles, or limited time in the domain). Insight is plausible but not clearly differentiated or unique. Some customer empathy evident but shallow articulation of workflows and pain points. | Strong domain depth or lived pain (ex-operator in the space, regulator, or clear insider). Non-obvious, high-conviction insight about the market, workflow, or customer. Customers and/or relevant peers/investors would recognise them as credible. Clear "why them." |

### Complementary Skills & Technical Depth (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can this team actually build and sell the product they're describing?
- Is there a credible balance across product, technical/operational, and commercial/growth?
- Is there at least one builder who can own the technical or product roadmap end-to-end?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No one with clear commercial or GTM instincts. No true technical owner; heavy reliance on agencies/contractors. Overlapping skill sets; critical gaps unacknowledged. | One strong technical or commercial lead but clear gaps in the other dimension. Complementary skills present but unclear role clarity; gaps are not explicitly acknowledged or planned for. | At least one founder with strong technical depth who can ship v1 alone. Clear complementarity across technical, product, and commercial. Evidence of shipping complex products or owning critical systems in prior roles and a clear view of who they need to hire next to round out the team. |

### Ambition, Ownership & Learning Velocity (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there evidence of bold vision and rapid iteration?
- How quickly do they test, learn, and adjust?
- Is the vision appropriately ambitious for a venture-scale outcome?
- Do they demonstrate discipline in what they don't do?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Slow iteration implied; long gaps between milestones. Vision is fuzzy or framed in buzzwords. Building in isolation with no evidence of customer contact. No clear timeline of product or company evolution; deck reads like a static idea rather than an evolving plan. | Some experiments and learning referenced but not systematic. Vision is big but not yet grounded in a defensible plan. Timeline, pivots, or product evolution are mentioned but unclear. | Rapid iteration loops (weekly or at least monthly) with concrete learnings and visible product/GTM changes. Strong bias to action; takes responsibility for failures. Clear, ambitious vision that could credibly produce a large, independent company. Deck highlights specific decisions or pivots based on customer or data feedback. |

---

## Market & Insight (28%)

### Problem Severity & Urgency (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- How painful is the problem for the target customer?
- Is it a "must-fix" problem with real budget and willingness to pay, or a "nice-to-have"?
- How frequently does the problem occur?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Pain is vague, optional, or clearly non-urgent. Hard to see a clear budget line or economic buyer. Problem is infrequent or peripheral to core workflows. | Problem is real and annoying, with some apparent budget. Customers acknowledge the issue but can live with current workarounds. Frequency is moderate; benefits are somewhat compelling but not burning. | Acute pain that materially impacts revenue, cost, risk, or compliance. Existing solutions are clearly inadequate; customers actively seeking alternatives. Clear budget owners and strong willingness to pay to solve it. |

### Market Size & Expansion Potential (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there a credible path to a large revenue opportunity?
- Is there an initial wedge with plausible expansion paths; can they expand beyond the initial wedge into adjacent workflows, segments, or products?
- Could this be a category-defining company?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Very narrow niche with limited expansion paths; likely <\$1B realistic TAM. Product looks like a feature, not a platform, and no credible thesis for expanding into adjacent workflows, segments, or products. | Reasonable wedge in a \$1-5B space, with some plausible adjacencies. Still unclear whether this can support a long-term platform or is a point solution. | Thoughtful explanation of how the wedge expands into a broader system of record or system of intelligence. Clear path to \$5B+ opportunity when including adjacencies and expansion across verticals/geos. |

### Timing, Macro & Platform Tailwinds (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why is now the right moment for this company?
- Are there regulatory, platform, or behavioural shifts that favour this company?
- Who else is solving this problem (startups, incumbents, in-house tools)?
- Is the market crowded, and if so, what is their wedge?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No compelling timing story; could have been built 5 years ago. Adoption might be slow or gated by dependencies outside founder control. | Some relevant tailwinds (regulatory, technology, behavioural) but mixed signals. Timing advantage not clearly articulated. | Strong "why now" thesis: clear tech, regulatory, or macro inflection that unlocks this opportunity now. Customers actively experimenting or budget newly available. |

### Competitive Landscape & Wedge (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the market crowded, and if so, what is their wedge?
- Can they realistically win the segment they're targeting?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Enters a crowded space with no clear wedge or angle. Pitch is easily confused with existing tools; differentiation is marketing-level only. | Some differentiation (vertical focus, UX, use case) but others are close. Wedge is plausible but fragile; incumbents could copy without much friction. | Sharp, defensible wedge (underserved subsegment, unique workflow, privileged data). Clear articulation of why incumbents or generalist solutions can't or won't follow. |

---

## Product & Tech (24%)

### Product-Workflow Fit & Solution Quality (7%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does the product integrate into real workflows and systems?
- Is there workflow integration that creates switching costs?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Feels like a productised demo; unclear daily or weekly use case. Adoption concentrated in one champion or team, not multiple users or teams. Product integrated only with light touchpoints. | Some real workflow integration; product improves productivity but could be optional. UX is primitive or rough around the edges but usable. Early thought given to quality and evaluation but limited frameworks. | Product is embedded in a critical workflow; integrated with existing systems (CRM, ERP, core tools). Clear daily/weekly usage pattern. Early guardrails and evaluation metrics in place; clear strategy for edge cases and quality assurance. |

### Defensibility & Moat (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there a credible path to a durable competitive advantage?
- What could be the source—proprietary data/IP, network effects, integrations, vertical workflow depth, brand, or switching costs?
- Will usage generate compounding advantages over time?
- Is this a "thin wrapper" or the start of a real moat?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No credible path to structural advantage; differentiation is speed or execution only. Product could be rebuilt by a competent team in 6-12 months. No proprietary data, network effects, or meaningful switching costs. Looks like a pure wrapper or feature that an incumbent could ship quickly. | Some proprietary elements emerging: early data advantage, custom integrations, workflow depth, or nascent community/network. Early signs of a flywheel but not yet clearly compounding. Advantage is real but narrow or fragile; a well-funded competitor or incumbent could catch up with focus. | Clear path to durable moat through one or more structural advantages: proprietary data/IP, network effects, deep workflow integration, vertical depth, or emerging brand. Usage pattern naturally increases the advantage over time. Switching costs are forming; replication would require significant time and investment. Clear rights to use and improve key assets over time. |

### Technical Architecture & Platform Risk (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the technical approach sound with manageable platform dependencies?
- Are key technical risks acknowledged?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Single critical dependency with existential risk. High sensitivity to third-party pricing or API changes. Obvious technical risks unacknowledged. | Some platform flexibility; differentiation exists beyond base dependencies. Manageable cost structure. Technical risks acknowledged with reasonable mitigation approach. | Architecture designed for flexibility and scale. Value clearly in application layer, not dependent on a single vendor. Costs and latency consistent at a conceptual level. Explicit plan for managing platform risk (e.g., multi-provider strategy, abstraction layers). |

### Stage & Readiness (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- What is actually built and in use today?
- Is there something demoable/usable by real users?
- Is the pace of shipping aligned with the time spent?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Idea-stage only; slides and vague prototypes with no working demo. Long time spent already with little to show. | MVP or alpha in place; some users/testers but not yet robust. Product still manual behind the scenes, but learning is happening. | Working alpha/beta; real users using it in their workflow, even if small numbers. Clear roadmap to production readiness within 6-12 months; team is shipping rapidly. |

## Traction & Learning (12%)

### Hypothesis Validation & Customer Engagement (7%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- What evidence exists beyond anecdotes?
- What proof exists that customers want this and will pay?
- Are they validating the right hypotheses for this stage?
- How deep are current customer conversations?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Only problem interviews with no structured learnings. Founder assumptions only; no external validation. Conversations scattered and generic; unclear if talking to the right customers. | LOIs, pilots, or waitlists from somewhat qualified ICPs. Some structured learnings on problem, willingness to pay, or behaviour. Design partners engaged but not yet paying. | Paying pilots, contracted users, or design partners with skin in the game. Strong revenue signals relative to time since launch or strong engagement/usage signals with a clear plan for monetisation. Clear articulation of what they've learned, what was invalidated, and how approach has evolved. |

### GTM Motion & Early Funnel Signals (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do they know who they are selling to, how, and why that motion fits the product/market?
- Is there early pipeline or repeatability emerging?
- Is there a clear path to their first 10 paying customers?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No clear target customer. No credible acquisition channel or hypothesis. Relying on 'build it and they will come' or vague virality assumptions. | GTM approach is plausible but untested. Some early acquisition signals but channel not yet repeatable. For B2B: founder-led sales working but not scalable. For B2C/e-commerce: acquisition channels identified with early CAC signals; conversion funnel showing promise. For PLG: self-serve funnel with activation metrics, organic or referral growth visible. | Evidence of repeatable acquisition emerging. Early sense of how customers move from awareness to activation. For B2B: clear playbook; founder can sell, pipeline building. For B2C/e-commerce: acquisition channels identified with early CAC signals; conversion funnel showing promise. For PLG: self-serve funnel with activation metrics, organic or referral growth visible. |

## Business & Fundability (8%)

### Capital Efficiency & Milestone Plan (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can they reach compelling seed milestones with this raise?
- Do they have a clear plan of what to prove with this round?
- Is use of funds clear and focused?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| High burn expectations; vague idea of milestones ("build product, hire sales"). Vague use of funds. Runway and hiring plan misaligned with pre-seed realities. Milestones described in terms of activities ("hire X, build Y") rather than outcomes ("prove Z about customers / revenue / product"). | Some sense of milestones (product + traction + hires) but not sharply defined. Some cushion. Reasonable runway plan but fuzzy on trade-offs and prioritisation. Round size is roughly appropriate for plan, but trade-offs and reduction scenarios are not clearly thought through. | Crisp 12-18 month milestone plan for this round (product, data, GTM, team). Lean, focused use of capital; clear understanding of what needs to be true for seed. |

### Next Round Narrative & Fundability (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there a clear story that a seed investor could underwrite?
- Are there obvious milestones and proof points that de-risk the big questions?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Unclear what success looks like. No coherent next-round story; unclear what changes between now and seed. No comparable precedents or milestones mismatched to stage. | Some comparables, rough sense of what seed investors need to see. Story is plausible but not crisp. Some risk on execution. Adjacent to typical seed profiles. | Clear validation milestones. Compelling narrative: "If we hit X, Y, Z, a quality seed fund will lean in." Named realistic comparables; strong understanding of the seed bar in this category. |

## Category Score Calculation

For each category, calculate the weighted average of its criteria, then normalize to a 0-10 scale:

\`\`\`
Category Score = Σ(criterion score × criterion weight) ÷ category total weight
\`\`\`

**Example for Team (28% total):**
- Founder-Market Fit (12%): scores 7
- Complementary Skills (8%): scores 6
- Ambition & Learning (8%): scores 8

Category weighted sum: (7 × 0.12) + (6 × 0.08) + (8 × 0.08) = 1.96
Team Score: 1.96 ÷ 0.28 = **7.0 out of 10**

---

## Overall Startup Score Calculation

\`\`\`
Overall Score = Σ(criterion score × criterion weight)
\`\`\`

This produces a score out of 10.

## Team (20%)

### Founder-Market Fit & Insight (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do the founders have deep experience with this problem, buyer, or industry?
- Do they hold a non-obvious insight that shapes how the market should work?
- Do they have a credible right to win?
- Are customers, partners, or hires willing to bet on them?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No clear link to the market or problem. Insight isn't differentiated; feels generic or second-hand. No clear "why them." Hard to see why customers or senior hires would take them seriously. | Some relevant domain experience (worked in adjacent roles, limited time in the domain). Insight is plausible but not clearly differentiated or unique, or sharper than other players in the space. Early customers and hires are credible but mostly opportunistic (friends, network). | Strong domain depth or lived pain (ex-operator in the space, regulator, or clear insider). Non-obvious, high-conviction insight about market, workflow, or customer reflected in product, GTM, and roadmap. Strong external validation: recognisable customers, repeat/back-channel praise, or a strong group of early hires/advisors. Clear "why them." |

### Complementary Skills & Technical Depth (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can this team build, scale, and sell the product they have in market?
- Is there a credible balance across product, technical/operational, and commercial?
- Is there at least one builder who owns the technical or product roadmap end-to-end?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No clear commercial or GTM lead; sales and BD are an afterthought. No true technical owner; heavy reliance on agencies/contractors or junior staff. Overlapping skill sets; critical gaps unacknowledged. | One strong technical or commercial lead but clear gaps in the other dimension. Complementary skills present but unclear role clarity; gaps not explicitly acknowledged or planned for. | Clear complementarity across technical, product, and commercial. At least one founder with strong technical depth who can ship v1+2 and lead the technical roadmap. Evidence of shipping complex products or owning critical systems previously. Early hiring and org design plans make sense for the next 12-24 months. |

### Execution, Hiring & Learning Velocity (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Are they executing and hiring at a pace that matches Seed stage?
- How quickly do they push data and feedback into product/GTM changes?
- Do they show discipline in what they don't do?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Slow iteration; milestones missed or frequently redefined. Hiring stalled or reactive; org changes driven by chaos not learning. Few concrete "we tried X, learned Y and changed Z" examples. | A few good hires, a few gaps; still filling key roles. Roadmap and past product evolution in the deck show a few clear "we tried X, learned Y and changed Z" cycles, but not yet a consistent system. | Rapid iteration visible (at least monthly) with concrete learnings driving product and GTM changes. Clear demonstration of attracting A-players; strong candidates and advisors leaning in. Priorities and execution feel balanced and focused; this team clearly knows how to scale from here. Timeline shows meaningful product and GTM progress over the last 6–18 months (not just big vision). |

---

## Market & Insight (21%)

### Problem Severity & Urgency (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- How painful is the problem for the target customer?
- Is it a "must-fix" problem with real budget and willingness to pay, or a "nice-to-have"?
- How frequently does the problem occur?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Pain still sounds "nice-to-have"; it is at best optional. Usage/retention suggests low urgency when the novelty wears off. | Problem is important but not yet mission-critical; budget exists in some segments. Customers appreciate the solution but can live without it. Retention and customer anecdotes indicate willingness to pay but timing is not urgent. | Acute pain that materially impacts revenue, cost, risk, or compliance. Customers actively seeking alternatives; existing solutions clearly inadequate. Sales feedback and usage/retention patterns are consistent with high urgency. |

### Market Size & Expansion Potential (7%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Could this become category-defining in its space?
- How expandable is the initial wedge into adjacencies and new segments?
- Is there a credible path to a multi-billion-dollar opportunity?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| TAM likely constrained to a small vertical or geography with limited expansion paths or the claimed TAM is not supported by credible bottom-up logic. Product looks like a feature, not a platform, and no credible thesis for expanding into adjacent workflows, segments, or products. Very narrow niche with limited expansion paths; likely <\$1B realistic TAM. | Reasonable wedge in a \$1-5B space, with some plausible adjacencies. Still unclear whether this can support a long-term platform or is a point solution. | Category-defining potential. Strong "land and expand" motion articulated and partially validated by customer migrations. TAM framing combines top-down and bottom-up, with assumptions spelled out. Clear path to \$5B+ opportunity when including adjacencies and expansion across verticals/geos. |

### Timing, Macro & Platform Tailwinds (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why is now the right moment for this company and category?
- Are there regulatory, platform, or behavioural shifts that favour this company?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No compelling "why now"; could have been built 5 years ago. Adoption might be slow or gated by dependencies outside founder control. | Some relevant tailwinds (regulatory, technology, behavioural) but mixed signals. Timing advantage not clearly articulated. | Strong "why now" thesis: clear tech, regulatory, or macro inflection that unlocks this opportunity now. Customers actively experimenting or budget newly available. |

### Competitive Landscape & Wedge (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Who else is solving this problem (startups, incumbents, in-house tools)?
- Is the market crowded, and if so, what is their wedge?
- Why will this team win against existing and new alternatives?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Enters a crowded space with no clear wedge or angle. Pitch is easily confused with existing tools; differentiation is marketing-level only. | Some differentiation (vertical focus, UX, use case) but others are close. Wedge is plausible but fragile; incumbents could copy without much friction. | Sharp, defensible wedge (underserved subsegment, unique workflow, privileged data). Clear articulation of why incumbents or generalist solutions can't or won't follow. Wedge validated by customer adoption and competitive wins. |

---

## Product & Tech (24%)

### Product-Workflow Fit & Solution Quality (6%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does the product integrate into real workflows and systems?
- Is there workflow integration that creates switching costs?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Feels like a productised demo; unclear daily or weekly use case. Adoption concentrated in one champion or team, not multiple users or teams. Some integration and light switching costs (data, set-up), but not yet "hard to rip out." | Some real workflow integration; product improves productivity but could be optional. UX is primitive or rough around the edges but usable. Some integration and light switching costs (data, set-up), but not yet "hard to rip out." | Product is embedded in a critical workflow; integrated with existing systems (CRM, ERP, core tools). Clear daily/weekly usage pattern; users would notice quickly if it disappeared. Switching would be painful (data migration, process change, habit disruption). Early guardrails and evaluation metrics in place. |

### Defensibility & Moat (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there a credible path to a durable competitive advantage?
- What could be the source—proprietary data/IP, network effects, integrations, vertical workflow depth, brand, or switching costs?
- Will usage generate compounding advantages over time?
- Is this a "thin wrapper" or the start of a real moat?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No credible path to structural advantage; differentiation is speed or execution only. Product could be rebuilt by a competent team in 6-12 months. No proprietary data, network effects, or meaningful switching costs. Looks like a pure wrapper or feature that an incumbent could ship quickly. | Some proprietary elements emerging: early data advantage, custom integrations, workflow depth, or nascent community/network. Early signs of a flywheel but not yet clearly compounding. Advantage is real but narrow or fragile; a well-funded competitor or incumbent could catch up with focus. Credible plan to widen the moat. | Clear moat emerging through one or more structural advantages: proprietary data/IP, network effects, deep workflow integration, vertical depth, or brand. Usage pattern naturally increases the advantage over time. Switching costs are forming; replication would require significant time and investment. Clear rights to use and improve key assets over time. |

### Technical Architecture, Scalability & Platform Risk (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the infra ready to support 10-50x growth?
- Are they overly dependent on a single vendor or platform?
- Is there a credible technical roadmap?
- Are key technical risks acknowledged and mitigated?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Fragile infra; outages or performance issues already limiting growth. Single critical dependency (cloud, model, marketplace, API) with no mitigation. No clear technical roadmap; big risks unacknowledged. | Some platform flexibility; differentiation exists beyond base dependencies. Manageable cost structure. Technical risks acknowledged with reasonable mitigation approach. | Architecture designed for scale, reliability, and cost control. Evidence of managing platform risk (e.g., multi-provider strategy, abstraction layers, ability to switch or degrade gracefully). Clear technical roadmap with data supporting strong economics at scale (latency, reliability, and unit cost). |

### Product Maturity & Stickiness (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- How mature is the product for Seed? Is usage consistent and growing?
- Do customers rely on it regularly? Would they notice if it disappeared?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Product feels like an early MVP; many manual processes behind the scenes. Low or inconsistent usage. Users could easily stop using without impact to their workflow. | Limited but growing usage with some regular patterns. Product still manual behind the scenes but improving. Some users engaged but not yet habitual. | Active, engaged usage with clear patterns indicating product is embedded in user behaviour. Users would notice quickly if product disappeared. By model: SaaS—healthy DAU/WAU ratios, clear daily/weekly usage patterns. Marketplace—repeat transactions, increasing activity per user. E-commerce—repeat purchase behaviour, returning customers. Fintech—transaction frequency stable or increasing. B2C—session frequency and engagement depth healthy. |

---

## Traction & GTM (20%)

### Traction & Retention Signals (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- What hard evidence exists that customers value and pay for this?
- Is the customer base retaining and expanding? Is growth durable?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Little or no revenue; mostly pilots, trials, or LOIs with weak commitment. Limited data on cohort behaviour. Growth happening but not yet consistent. No insight into whether customers stay or expand. High churn or not measured. | Revenue building but small relative to time in market. Some customers returning but limited data on cohort behaviour. Growth happening but not yet consistent. Some expansion occurring but not yet systematic. Pipeline building but conversion uncertain. Moderate customer concentration. | Strong revenue or usage scale for the stage with customers across multiple accounts. Retention and expansion strong relative to category norms. Growth is consistent and durable, not lumpy or one-off. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—\$50-150k+ ARR, 10-20+ customers, >85% gross retention, 10-20% MoM growth. Marketplace—\$500k+ GMV, meaningful take rate, cohort retention >50% at M6; liquidity improving. Fintech—\$1M+ TPV or 1k+ transacting users. Usage-based—strong consumption growth (15%+ MoM), logo retention >80%, expansion visible. B2C—5-10k+ engaged users, D30 retention >20%, early monetisation or clear path. |

### GTM Motion & Distribution Strategy (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do they know how to find, acquire, and retain customers at this stage?
- Is this the beginning of a repeatable, scalable GTM motion?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Sales are ad hoc and entirely founder-led with no pattern. No clear target customer, channels or opportunity. No credible acquisition channel or hypothesis. Relying on 'build it and they will come' or vague virality assumptions. | Defined target customer and early channels identified (outbound, PLG, partners, etc). Some repeatability in getting meetings or sign-ups, but conversion not yet consistent. GTM motion (PLG vs founder-led vs channel) is plausible but early. | Repeatable motion emerging: clear playbook from top-of-funnel to closed. Early inbound or referral-driven growth. Pipeline visibility with improving conversion. Path to scaling beyond founder-led sales is credible. For PLG/B2C motion, early signs of organic growth (cohorts, invite loops, word-of-mouth). ICP and buyer profile are sharp; they know exactly who they win with. |

---

## Business & Fundability (15%)

### Capital Efficiency & Runway Plan (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can they reach a credible Series A bar with this round?
- Do they have a clear plan of what to prove with this capital?
- Use of funds

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| High burn expectations with late revenue; runway short relative to plan. Use of funds vague. Hiring and plan profile misaligned with stage and economics. | Some sense of milestones (product + traction + hires) but not sharply defined. Some cushion. Reasonable runway plan but fuzzy on trade-offs and prioritisation. Round size is roughly appropriate for plan, but trade-offs and reduction scenarios are not clearly thought through. | Crisp 12-18 month milestone plan for this round (product, data, GTM, team). Lean, focused use of capital; clear understanding of what needs to be true for Series A. Milestones are outcome-based, not activity-based. |

### Unit Economics (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Are gross margins healthy for the category?
- Is there early line of sight to sensible customer acquisition cost, payback period, and lifetime value?
- Is there a path to operating leverage?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Gross margins poor for category with no clear path to improvement. Customer acquisition costs not tracked or clearly unsustainable. Heavy services component with no credible route to leverage. Value created but not captured. | Gross margins in acceptable range for category; improving with scale expected. Customer economics early or noisy, path to healthy economics plausible but unproven. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—50-70% gross margin. Marketplace—40-60% on net revenue. Fintech—20-40% (varies by product). Usage-based/Infra—40-60%. E-commerce—30-50% (depends on fulfilment). | Healthy gross margin for category. Customer economics showing positive trajectory (efficient acquisition, reasonable payback, strong lifetime value relative to acquisition cost). Clear operating leverage emerging as company scales. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—>75% gross margin, CAC payback <18 months, LTV/CAC >3x. Marketplace—>65% on net revenue. Fintech—>50% or net revenue, improving take rate. Fintech—>40%+ (or justified lower with volume leverage). Usage-based/Infra—>65%. E-commerce—>55% (or clear path with scale). |

### Fundability & Series A Path (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- If they execute their plan, will Series A investors be excited?
- Are there clear metrics and proof points that de-risk the big questions?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No coherent story of what an A-ready company looks like for this business; unclear what changes between now and Series A. Milestones either unrealistic or too weak to justify a large round. No comparable precedents or milestones mismatched to stage. | Some sense of A-round comparables; rough sense of what Series A investors need to see. Story is plausible but not crisp; some key risks still unresolved. | Clear validation milestones and crisp narrative: "If we hit X, Y, Z, a quality Series A fund will lean in." Named realistic comparables; strong understanding of current Series A bar in this category. Clear path to metrics and proof points that Series A investors in this category expect. |

### Thesis Fit (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is this AI-First (not traditional SaaS with AI layered on)?
- Is this B2B/Enterprise in our core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure)?
- Does it have global scale potential?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Weak fit: B2C, non-AI-native, or outside core sectors. No clear path to global scale. | Partial fit: B2B but not clearly AI-first, or AI-native but outside core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure). Could still be worth it for exceptional team and traction, but not a natural fit for Arconic's value-add. | Strong fit: AI-First B2B/Enterprise in core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure). Vertical focus with global expansion potential. Arconic's network (banks, telcos, retailers) and AI expertise directly relevant to scaling this company. |

## Category Score Calculation

For each category, calculate the weighted average of its criteria, then normalize to a 0-10 scale:

\`\`\`
Category Score = Σ(criterion score × criterion weight) ÷ category total weight
\`\`\`

**Example for Team (20% total):**
- Founder-Market Fit (10%): scores 7
- Complementary Skills (5%): scores 6
- Execution & Learning (5%): scores 8

Category weighted sum: (7 × 0.10) + (6 × 0.05) + (8 × 0.05) = 1.40
Team Score: 1.40 ÷ 0.20 = **7.0 out of 10**

## Team (15%)

### Founder-Market Fit & Insight (6%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do the founders have deep experience with this problem, buyer, or industry?
- Do they hold a non-obvious insight that shapes how the market should work?
- Do they have a credible right to win?
- Are they recognised as credible leaders in this space (or clearly on that path)?
- Can they attract top talent and partners?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No clear link to the market or problem. Insight isn't differentiated; feels generic or second-hand. No clear "why them." Not clear why this team wins versus adjacent specialists or incumbents. Struggling to attract senior talent, strategic partners and/or customers. Hiring adequate but not exceptional talent. | Some relevant domain experience (worked in adjacent roles, limited time in the domain). Insight is plausible but not clearly differentiated or unique, or sharper than other players in the space. Some external validation (customers, hires, partners) but not yet seen as category leaders. | Deep domain expertise or lived pain (ex-operator in the space or clearly becoming the reference team for this category). Recognised thought leaders in the space or clearly becoming the reference team for this category. Non-obvious, high-conviction insight reflected in product and GTM that competitors haven't reached. Strong external validation: recognisable customers, repeat/back-channel praise, or a strong group of early hires/advisors. Clear "why them." Attracting top-tier talent and strategic partners who want to be part of this journey. |

### Leadership & Scaling Capability (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can leadership scale the company to the next phase?
- Have they built and managed teams at this stage before, or do they demonstrate clear ability to learn?
- Can they attract and retain senior talent?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Gaps in leadership team; no clear plan to fill. Founders struggling with delegation or scaling beyond hands-on management. No evidence of building teams beyond early stage. | Adequate leadership team with some gaps acknowledged. Some experience scaling teams but not at this stage/pace. Hiring plan exists but key roles unfilled or roles filled with less vetted candidates. | Proven executives in key roles (or clear pipeline). Founders have successfully scaled teams before or demonstrate strong coachability (e.g., upgrading leaders, delegating effectively, seeking feedback). Clear hiring plan for next phase. Board and advisors add real value. |

### Execution & Org Building (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the company executing at Series A pace?
- Are they shipping product, closing deals, and hitting milestones consistently?
- Is the culture and org set up for scale?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Missed milestones; execution feels chaotic. High turnover or culture issues evident. Shipping velocity has slowed as company scaled. Org structure unclear or misaligned. | Generally hitting milestones with some misses. Culture is functional but not a clear advantage. Execution is adequate but not exceptional. Org structure exists but still evolving. | Consistent track record of hitting milestones. Strong execution culture; team are aligned and accountable. Shipping velocity maintained at scale. Clear operating cadence and metrics framework. Org design appropriate for current stage with clear plan for next phase. |

## Market & Insight (18%)

### Market Size & Dynamics (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the market large enough to support a venture-scale outcome?
- Is it growing? What is the competitive structure—fragmented, consolidating, winner-take-most?
- Is the company positioned to lead?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Market constrained (e.g., <\$1B TAM) with limited expansion paths. Company is a feature or niche player, not a platform. Highly fragmented with no path to consolidation, or dominated by entrenched incumbents. | Mid-sized market (e.g., \$1-5B TAM) with reasonable growth. Company could be a solid outcome but unclear if it can be a category leader. Competitive structure is manageable but not clearly favourable. | Large market (e.g., \$5B+ TAM) with strong growth or clear expansion thesis. Competitive structure favours emerging leaders (fragmented and consolidating, or underserved by incumbents). Company positioned to define or lead the category. Clear "land and expand" motion validated by customer progression. |

### Timing & Macro Drivers (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why is now the right moment for this company and category?
- Is it growing? What is the competitive structure—fragmented, consolidating, winner-take-most?
- Is the company positioned to lead?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Market constrained (e.g., <\$1B TAM) with limited expansion paths. Company is a feature or niche player, not a platform.

Competitive structure favours emerging leaders (fragmented and consolidating, or underserved by incumbents). Company positioned to define or lead the category. Clear "land and expand" motion validated by customer progression. |

### Competitive Position (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- How is the company perceived in the market?
- Are they winning head-to-head against competitors?
- Is their wedge validated and expanding?
- Are they becoming the default choice in their segment?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Crowded market with no clear differentiation. Losing competitive deals or winning on price/relationships only. Wedge unclear or not defensible. Not yet on the radar of key customers or analysts. | Winning some competitive deals; differentiation recognised by customers. Wedge is plausible but others are close; incumbents could copy without much friction. Emerging as a strong player but not yet the default choice. Position defensible for 12-18 months. | Clear market leadership in target segment; winning competitive deals consistently. Initial wedge has been validated and is expanding. Clear articulation of why incumbents or generalist solutions can't or won't follow. Recognised by customers and ecosystem as the default or a leading choice. Brand and customer preference emerging. Competitors increasingly positioning relative to them. |

## Product & Tech (20%)

### Product-Market Fit & Customer Love (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do customers love this product?
- Would they be very disappointed if it disappeared?
- Is there evidence of organic advocacy, referrals, and usage-driven growth?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Weak usage metrics. PMF not yet proven; still iterating on core value prop. Low emotional attachment; customers could easily live without the product. | Some traction with improving engagement. PMF exists in a segment but not yet broad. Good customer anecdotes but advocacy not yet consistent. Usage growing but not yet habitual. | Clear PMF evidenced by strong engagement and organic growth. Customer unprompting and referring others. High NPS or equivalent advocacy. Reference customers enthusiastic. Product is "must-have" not "nice-to-have"; users would be upset if it disappeared. |

### Defensibility & Moat (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there a credible path to a durable competitive advantage?
- What could be the source—proprietary data/IP, network effects, integrations, vertical workflow depth, brand, or switching costs?
- Will usage generate compounding advantages over time?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No credible path to structural advantage; differentiation is speed or execution only. Product could be rebuilt by a competent team in 6-12 months. No proprietary data, network effects, or meaningful switching costs. Looks like a pure wrapper or feature that an incumbent could ship quickly. | Some proprietary elements emerging: early data advantage, custom integrations, workflow depth, or nascent community/network. Moat is real but narrow; requires continued execution to maintain. Switching costs exist but are surmountable. | Clear moat emerging through one or more structural advantages: proprietary data/IP, network effects, deep workflow integration, vertical depth, or brand. Usage pattern naturally increases the advantage over time. Switching costs are forming; replication would require significant time and investment. Clear rights to use and improve key assets over time. Clear articulation of why competitors can't easily replicate. |

### Technical Infrastructure & Scalability (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the infra ready to support 10-50x growth?
- Are they overly dependent on a single vendor or platform?
- Is there a credible technical roadmap?
- Are key technical risks acknowledged and mitigated?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Fragile infrastructure; scaling concerns evident. Single critical dependency (model provider, cloud, API) with no mitigation strategy. Security or compliance gaps that limit enterprise sales. No clear technical roadmap; big risks unacknowledged. | Infrastructure adequate for current scale; roadmap to handle growth. Some platform/vendor dependencies but manageable. Technical risks acknowledged with reasonable mitigation approach. Security/compliance basics in place. | Architecture designed for scale, reliability, and cost control. Evidence of managing platform risk (e.g., multi-provider strategy, abstraction layers, ability to switch or degrade gracefully). Clear technical roadmap with data supporting strong economics at scale (latency, reliability, and unit cost). Strong security posture; enterprise-ready (SOC2, ISO, etc.). |

- Is retention healthy?
- Is there customer concentration risk?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Revenue below category expectations for stage. Growth slowing, lumpy, or unpredictable. Retention concerns or high churn. Heavy concentration in one or few customers. Revenue quality concerns (one-off, services-heavy). | Revenue building with reasonable growth. Retention metrics solid but not exceptional. Some expansion occurring but not yet systematic. Pipeline building but conversion uncertain. Moderate customer concentration. | Revenue scale and growth rate strong for category and stage. Retention and expansion metrics at or above category benchmarks. Growth is durable and predictable, not lumpy. Diversified customer base. Clear path to next stage of scale. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—\$1.5-3M+ ARR, 2-3x YoY growth, >90% gross retention, >100% net retention. Marketplace—\$5-15M+ GMV, take rate stable/improving, cohort retention >60% at M12, clear liquidity. Fintech—\$10M+ TPV or significant transaction volume, unit economics proven; frequency stable. Usage-based—\$1-2M+ revenue, consumption growth >100% YoY, net retention >110%, logo retention >85%. B2C—50-100k+ engaged users, strong retention curves, proven monetisation, path to scale. |

### Sales & Growth Engine (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is GTM efficient and scalable?
- Is there a repeatable playbook with strong pipeline?
- Is the motion proven beyond founder-led sales?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Founder-led and ad hoc; no repeatable playbook. Pipeline thin or unpredictable. Channel strategy unclear. No evidence of scalability beyond founders. | Repeatable playbook emerging; some hires productive and ramping. Pipeline building; conversion rates stabilising. One or two channels working but not yet proven at scale. Clear path to scale GTM with this raise. For PLG/usage-led motions, strong self-serve funnel with clear understanding of activation, conversion, and expansion levers. | Scalable GTM engine with proven playbook from top-of-funnel to closed. Strong pipeline with predictable conversion. Multiple channels or motions validated. Team ramping successfully; sales hires hitting quota. Clear path to scale GTM with this raise. For PLG/usage-led motions, strong self-serve funnel with clear understanding of activation, conversion, and expansion levers; ICP and buyer profile are sharp. |

### Unit Economics (6%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Are gross margins healthy for the category?
- Are customer economics (acquisition cost, payback, lifetime value) proven or on a credible path?
- Is there operating leverage?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Gross margins poor for category with no clear path to improvement. Customer acquisition costs not tracked or clearly unsustainable. Heavy services component or implementation drag. Burn efficiency concerning. | Gross margins in acceptable range for category; improving with scale. Customer economics reasonable but not yet best-in-class. Some operating leverage emerging. Path to efficiency clearer with scale. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—60-75% gross margin. Marketplace—50-65% on net revenue. Fintech—30-50%. Usage-based/Infra—50-65%. E-commerce—40-55%. | Healthy gross margin for category. Customer economics proven (efficient acquisition, reasonable payback, strong lifetime value relative to acquisition cost). Clear operating leverage emerging as company scales. Burn efficiency appropriate for growth rate. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—>75% gross margin, CAC payback <18 months. LTV/CAC >3x. Marketplace—>65% on net revenue. Fintech—>50%+ (or justified lower with volume leverage). Usage-based/Infra—>65%. E-commerce—>55% (or clear path with scale). |

## Business & Fundability (19%)

### Outcome Potential & Exit Paths (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Could this be a fund-returning investment?
- What are the paths to a large outcome (IPO, strategic acquisition, private equity)?
- Does the market structure support winner-take-most or winner-take-large dynamics?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Limited outcome ceiling (difficult to see path to \$500M+ exit). Few relevant acquirers; IPO path unclear. Market structure doesn't favour consolidation or outsized winners. | Reasonable outcome potential (\$500M-\$1B exit plausible). Some comparable exits in the space but not yet clear category leaders. Path to larger outcome exists but requires significant execution. Some strategic interest in the space. | Clear potential for large outcome (\$1B+ exit) with multiple paths (IPO, PE/M&A). Acquisition, private equity). Market structure supports winner-take-most or winner-take-large dynamics. Strong strategic interest in the space. Comparable companies at \$5B+ scale validate the ceiling. Could be a fund-returning investment. |

### Series B Path & Milestones (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the company set up for durable growth and Series B?
- Are there clear milestones that de-risk the big questions?
- Will top-tier Series B investors be excited by the trajectory?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Unclear what success looks like for Series B. No coherent next-round story; unclear what changes between now and Series B. Key risks unaddressed. Metrics and reporting immature. | Some sense of Series B bar and path to get there. Story is plausible but not crisp; some key risks still unresolved. | Clear validation milestones and crisp narrative: "If we hit X, Y, Z, a quality Series B fund will lean in." Named realistic comparables; strong understanding of current Series B bar in this category. Leading indicators suggest company will be competitive for top-tier Series B. Key risks being systematically de-risked. Metrics, reporting, and instrumentation at a level that institutional investors expect. |

### Thesis Fit (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is this AI-First (not traditional SaaS with AI layered on)?
- Is this B2B/Enterprise in our core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure)?
- Does it have global scale potential?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Weak fit: B2C, non-AI-native, or outside core sectors. No clear path to global scale. | Partial fit: B2B but not clearly AI-first, or AI-native but outside core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure). Could still be worth it for exceptional team and traction, but not a natural fit for Arconic's value-add. | Strong fit: AI-First B2B/Enterprise in core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure). Vertical focus with global expansion potential. Arconic's network (banks, telcos, retailers) and AI expertise directly relevant to scaling this company. |

### Capital Efficiency & Use of Funds (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the raise sized appropriately?
- Is the use of funds clear and aligned with plan or market?
- Can they reach Series B bar with this capital?
- Is burn rate appropriate for the stage and growth?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Raise sized misaligned with plan or market. Use of funds vague or unfocused. Burn rate concerning relative to progress. Runway insufficient to reach key milestones. Milestones described in terms of activities ("hire X, build Y") rather than outcomes. | Reasonable raise size with adequate runway. Use of funds generally clear but some questions on allocation. Should reach key milestones but limited cushion. | Crisp 18-24 month milestone plan for this round (product, GTM, team, expansion). Lean, focused use of capital; clear understanding of what needs to be true for Series B. Milestones are outcome-based, not activity-based. Burn efficiency appropriate for growth rate. High conviction in reaching Series B with this capital. |

## Category Score Calculation

For each category, calculate the weighted average of its criteria, then normalize to a 0-10 scale:

\`\`\`
Category Score = Σ(criterion score × criterion weight) ÷ category total weight
\`\`\`

**Example for Team (15% total):**
- Founder-Market Fit (6%): scores 7
- Leadership & Scaling (5%): scores 6
- Execution & Org (4%): scores 8

Category weighted sum: (7 × 0.06) + (6 × 0.05) + (8 × 0.04) = 1.04
Team Score: 1.04 ÷ 0.15 = **6.9 out of 10**

---

## Overall Startup Score Calculation

\`\`\`
Overall Score = Σ(criterion score × criterion weight)
\`\`\`

This produces a score out of 10.
