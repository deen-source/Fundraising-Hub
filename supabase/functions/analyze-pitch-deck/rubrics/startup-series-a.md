## Team (15%)

### Founder-Market Fit & Insight (6%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do the founders have deep experience with this problem, buyer, or industry?
- Do they hold a non-obvious insight that shapes how the market should work?
- Do they have a credible right to win?
- Are they recognised as credible leaders in this space (or clearly on that path)?
- Can they attract top talent and partners?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No clear link to the market or problem. Insight isn't differentiated; feels generic or second-hand. No clear "why them." Not clear why this team wins versus adjacent specialists or incumbents. Struggling to attract senior talent, strategic partners and/or customers. Hiring adequate but not exceptional talent. | Some relevant domain experience (worked in adjacent roles, limited time in the domain). Insight is plausible but not clearly differentiated or unique, or sharper than other players in the space. Some external validation (customers, hires, partners) but not yet seen as category leaders. | Deep domain expertise or lived pain (ex-operator in the space or clearly becoming the reference team for this category). Recognised thought leaders in the space or clearly becoming the reference team for this category. Non-obvious, high-conviction insight reflected in product and GTM that competitors haven't reached. Strong external validation: recognisable customers, repeat/back-channel praise, or a strong group of early hires/advisors. Clear "why them." Attracting top-tier talent and strategic partners who want to be part of this journey. |

### Leadership & Scaling Capability (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can leadership scale the company to the next phase?
- Have they built and managed teams at this stage before, or do they demonstrate clear ability to learn?
- Can they attract and retain senior talent?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Gaps in leadership team; no clear plan to fill. Founders struggling with delegation or scaling beyond hands-on management. No evidence of building teams beyond early stage. | Adequate leadership team with some gaps acknowledged. Some experience scaling teams but not at this stage/pace. Hiring plan exists but key roles unfilled or roles filled with less vetted candidates. | Proven executives in key roles (or clear pipeline). Founders have successfully scaled teams before or demonstrate strong coachability (e.g., upgrading leaders, delegating effectively, seeking feedback). Clear hiring plan for next phase. Board and advisors add real value. |

### Execution & Org Building (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the company executing at Series A pace?
- Are they shipping product, closing deals, and hitting milestones consistently?
- Is the culture and org set up for scale?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Missed milestones; execution feels chaotic. High turnover or culture issues evident. Shipping velocity has slowed as company scaled. Org structure unclear or misaligned. | Generally hitting milestones with some misses. Culture is functional but not a clear advantage. Execution is adequate but not exceptional. Org structure exists but still evolving. | Consistent track record of hitting milestones. Strong execution culture; team are aligned and accountable. Shipping velocity maintained at scale. Clear operating cadence and metrics framework. Org design appropriate for current stage with clear plan for next phase. |

## Market & Insight (18%)

### Market Size & Dynamics (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the market large enough to support a venture-scale outcome?
- Is it growing? What is the competitive structure—fragmented, consolidating, winner-take-most?
- Is the company positioned to lead?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Market constrained (e.g., <$1B TAM) with limited expansion paths. Company is a feature or niche player, not a platform. Highly fragmented with no path to consolidation, or dominated by entrenched incumbents. | Mid-sized market (e.g., $1-5B TAM) with reasonable growth. Company could be a solid outcome but unclear if it can be a category leader. Competitive structure is manageable but not clearly favourable. | Large market (e.g., $5B+ TAM) with strong growth or clear expansion thesis. Competitive structure favours emerging leaders (fragmented and consolidating, or underserved by incumbents). Company positioned to define or lead the category. Clear "land and expand" motion validated by customer progression. |

### Timing & Macro Drivers (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why is now the right moment for this company and category?
- Is it growing? What is the competitive structure—fragmented, consolidating, winner-take-most?
- Is the company positioned to lead?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Market constrained (e.g., <$1B TAM) with limited expansion paths. Company is a feature or niche player, not a platform. Highly fragmented with no path to consolidation, or dominated by entrenched incumbents. | Mid-sized market (e.g., $1-5B TAM) with reasonable growth. Company could be a solid outcome but unclear if it can be a category leader. Competitive structure is manageable but not clearly favourable. | Large market (e.g., $5B+ TAM) with strong growth or clear expansion thesis. Competitive structure favours emerging leaders (fragmented and consolidating, or underserved by incumbents). Company positioned to define or lead the category. Clear "land and expand" motion validated by customer progression. |

### Competitive Position (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- How is the company perceived in the market?
- Are they winning head-to-head against competitors?
- Is their wedge validated and expanding?
- Are they becoming the default choice in their segment?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Crowded market with no clear differentiation. Losing competitive deals or winning on price/relationships only. Wedge unclear or not defensible. Not yet on the radar of key customers or analysts. | Winning some competitive deals; differentiation recognised by customers. Wedge is plausible but others are close; incumbents could copy without much friction. Emerging as a strong player but not yet the default choice. Position defensible for 12-18 months. | Clear market leadership in target segment; winning competitive deals consistently. Initial wedge has been validated and is expanding. Clear articulation of why incumbents or generalist solutions can't or won't follow. Recognised by customers and ecosystem as the default or a leading choice. Brand and customer preference emerging. Competitors increasingly positioning relative to them. |

## Product & Tech (20%)

### Product-Market Fit & Customer Love (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do customers love this product?
- Would they be very disappointed if it disappeared?
- Is there evidence of organic advocacy, referrals, and usage-driven growth?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Weak usage metrics. PMF not yet proven; still iterating on core value prop. Low emotional attachment; customers could easily live without the product. | Some traction with improving engagement. PMF exists in a segment but not yet broad. Good customer anecdotes but advocacy not yet consistent. Usage growing but not yet habitual. | Clear PMF evidenced by strong engagement and organic growth. Customer unprompting and referring others. High NPS or equivalent advocacy. Reference customers enthusiastic. Product is "must-have" not "nice-to-have"; users would be upset if it disappeared. |

### Defensibility & Moat (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there a credible path to a durable competitive advantage?
- What could be the source—proprietary data/IP, network effects, integrations, vertical workflow depth, brand, or switching costs?
- Will usage generate compounding advantages over time?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No credible path to structural advantage; differentiation is speed or execution only. Product could be rebuilt by a competent team in 6-12 months. No proprietary data, network effects, or meaningful switching costs. Looks like a pure wrapper or feature that an incumbent could ship quickly. | Some proprietary elements emerging: early data advantage, custom integrations, workflow depth, or nascent community/network. Moat is real but narrow; requires continued execution to maintain. Switching costs exist but are surmountable. | Clear moat emerging through one or more structural advantages: proprietary data/IP, network effects, deep workflow integration, vertical depth, or brand. Usage pattern naturally increases the advantage over time. Switching costs are forming; replication would require significant time and investment. Clear rights to use and improve key assets over time. Clear articulation of why competitors can't easily replicate. |

### Technical Infrastructure & Scalability (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the infra ready to support 10-50x growth?
- Are they overly dependent on a single vendor or platform?
- Is there a credible technical roadmap?
- Are key technical risks acknowledged and mitigated?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Fragile infrastructure; scaling concerns evident. Single critical dependency (model provider, cloud, API) with no mitigation strategy. Security or compliance gaps that limit enterprise sales. No clear technical roadmap; big risks unacknowledged. | Infrastructure adequate for current scale; roadmap to handle growth. Some platform/vendor dependencies but manageable. Technical risks acknowledged with reasonable mitigation approach. Security/compliance basics in place. | Architecture designed for scale, reliability, and cost control. Evidence of managing platform risk (e.g., multi-provider strategy, abstraction layers, ability to switch or degrade gracefully). Clear technical roadmap with data supporting strong economics at scale (latency, reliability, and unit cost). Strong security posture; enterprise-ready (SOC2, ISO, etc.). |

## Traction & GTM (28%)

### Revenue & Growth Quality (14%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is revenue at appropriate scale for Series A?
- Is growth strong, durable, and predictable?
- Is retention healthy?
- Is there customer concentration risk?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Revenue below category expectations for stage. Growth slowing, lumpy, or unpredictable. Retention concerns or high churn. Heavy concentration in one or few customers. Revenue quality concerns (one-off, services-heavy). | Revenue building with reasonable growth. Retention metrics solid but not exceptional. Some expansion occurring but not yet systematic. Pipeline building but conversion uncertain. Moderate customer concentration. | Revenue scale and growth rate strong for category and stage. Retention and expansion metrics at or above category benchmarks. Growth is durable and predictable, not lumpy. Diversified customer base. Clear path to next stage of scale. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—$1.5-3M+ ARR, 2-3x YoY growth, >90% gross retention, >100% net retention. Marketplace—$5-15M+ GMV, take rate stable/improving, cohort retention >60% at M12, clear liquidity. Fintech—$10M+ TPV or significant transaction volume, unit economics proven; frequency stable. Usage-based—$1-2M+ revenue, consumption growth >100% YoY, net retention >110%, logo retention >85%. B2C—50-100k+ engaged users, strong retention curves, proven monetisation, path to scale. |

### Sales & Growth Engine (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is GTM efficient and scalable?
- Is there a repeatable playbook with strong pipeline?
- Is the motion proven beyond founder-led sales?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Founder-led and ad hoc; no repeatable playbook. Pipeline thin or unpredictable. Channel strategy unclear. No evidence of scalability beyond founders. | Repeatable playbook emerging; some hires productive and ramping. Pipeline building; conversion rates stabilising. One or two channels working but not yet proven at scale. Clear path to scale GTM with this raise. For PLG/usage-led motions, strong self-serve funnel with clear understanding of activation, conversion, and expansion levers. | Scalable GTM engine with proven playbook from top-of-funnel to closed. Strong pipeline with predictable conversion. Multiple channels or motions validated. Team ramping successfully; sales hires hitting quota. Clear path to scale GTM with this raise. For PLG/usage-led motions, strong self-serve funnel with clear understanding of activation, conversion, and expansion levers; ICP and buyer profile are sharp. |

### Unit Economics (6%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Are gross margins healthy for the category?
- Are customer economics (acquisition cost, payback, lifetime value) proven or on a credible path?
- Is there operating leverage?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Gross margins poor for category with no clear path to improvement. Customer acquisition costs not tracked or clearly unsustainable. Heavy services component or implementation drag. Burn efficiency concerning. | Gross margins in acceptable range for category; improving with scale. Customer economics reasonable but not yet best-in-class. Some operating leverage emerging. Path to efficiency clearer with scale. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—60-75% gross margin. Marketplace—50-65% on net revenue. Fintech—30-50%. Usage-based/Infra—50-65%. E-commerce—40-55%. | Healthy gross margin for category. Customer economics proven (efficient acquisition, reasonable payback, strong lifetime value relative to acquisition cost). Clear operating leverage emerging as company scales. Burn efficiency appropriate for growth rate. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—>75% gross margin, CAC payback <18 months. LTV/CAC >3x. Marketplace—>65% on net revenue. Fintech—>50%+ (or justified lower with volume leverage). Usage-based/Infra—>65%. E-commerce—>55% (or clear path with scale). |

## Business & Fundability (19%)

### Outcome Potential & Exit Paths (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Could this be a fund-returning investment?
- What are the paths to a large outcome (IPO, strategic acquisition, private equity)?
- Does the market structure support winner-take-most or winner-take-large dynamics?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Limited outcome ceiling (difficult to see path to $500M+ exit). Few relevant acquirers; IPO path unclear. Market structure doesn't favour consolidation or outsized winners. | Reasonable outcome potential ($500M-$1B exit plausible). Some comparable exits in the space but not yet clear category leaders. Path to larger outcome exists but requires significant execution. Some strategic interest in the space. | Clear potential for large outcome ($1B+ exit) with multiple paths (IPO, PE/M&A). Acquisition, private equity). Market structure supports winner-take-most or winner-take-large dynamics. Strong strategic interest in the space. Comparable companies at $5B+ scale validate the ceiling. Could be a fund-returning investment. |

### Series B Path & Milestones (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the company set up for durable growth and Series B?
- Are there clear milestones that de-risk the big questions?
- Will top-tier Series B investors be excited by the trajectory?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Unclear what success looks like for Series B. No coherent next-round story; unclear what changes between now and Series B. Key risks unaddressed. Metrics and reporting immature. | Some sense of Series B bar and path to get there. Story is plausible but not crisp; some key risks still unresolved. | Clear validation milestones and crisp narrative: "If we hit X, Y, Z, a quality Series B fund will lean in." Named realistic comparables; strong understanding of current Series B bar in this category. Leading indicators suggest company will be competitive for top-tier Series B. Key risks being systematically de-risked. Metrics, reporting, and instrumentation at a level that institutional investors expect. |

### Thesis Fit (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is this AI-First (not traditional SaaS with AI layered on)?
- Is this B2B/Enterprise in our core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure)?
- Does it have global scale potential?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Weak fit: B2C, non-AI-native, or outside core sectors. No clear path to global scale. | Partial fit: B2B but not clearly AI-first, or AI-native but outside core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure). Could still be worth it for exceptional team and traction, but not a natural fit for Arconic's value-add. | Strong fit: AI-First B2B/Enterprise in core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure). Vertical focus with global expansion potential. Arconic's network (banks, telcos, retailers) and AI expertise directly relevant to scaling this company. |

### Capital Efficiency & Use of Funds (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the raise sized appropriately?
- Is the use of funds clear and aligned with plan or market?
- Can they reach Series B bar with this capital?
- Is burn rate appropriate for the stage and growth?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Raise sized misaligned with plan or market. Use of funds vague or unfocused. Burn rate concerning relative to progress. Runway insufficient to reach key milestones. Milestones described in terms of activities ("hire X, build Y") rather than outcomes. | Reasonable raise size with adequate runway. Use of funds generally clear but some questions on allocation. Should reach key milestones but limited cushion. | Crisp 18-24 month milestone plan for this round (product, GTM, team, expansion). Lean, focused use of capital; clear understanding of what needs to be true for Series B. Milestones are outcome-based, not activity-based. Burn efficiency appropriate for growth rate. High conviction in reaching Series B with this capital. |

## Category Score Calculation

For each category, calculate the weighted average of its criteria, then normalize to a 0-10 scale:

```
Category Score = Σ(criterion score × criterion weight) ÷ category total weight
```

**Example for Team (15% total):**
- Founder-Market Fit (6%): scores 7
- Leadership & Scaling (5%): scores 6
- Execution & Org (4%): scores 8

Category weighted sum: (7 × 0.06) + (6 × 0.05) + (8 × 0.04) = 1.04
Team Score: 1.04 ÷ 0.15 = **6.9 out of 10**

---

## Overall Startup Score Calculation

```
Overall Score = Σ(criterion score × criterion weight)
```

This produces a score out of 10.
