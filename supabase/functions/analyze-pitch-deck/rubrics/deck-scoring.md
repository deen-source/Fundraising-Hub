## 4. Design & Visual Clarity (10%)

**Focus:** Is the deck professional, legible, and visually clear?

### Design Principles: Legible, Simple, Obvious

**Legible:**
- ✅ Font size 20+ is ideal; occasional smaller text in charts/tables is acceptable if still legible
- ✅ Simple, readable font choice
- ✅ Good contrast with background
- ✅ High quality images (not pixelated)
- ❌ Small fonts requiring zoom
- ❌ Poor contrast (light text on light background)
- ❌ Low quality or stretched images

**Simple:**
- ✅ One idea per slide
- ✅ <50 words per slide is ideal; occasional denser slides (financials, roadmap) are acceptable if clearly structured
- ✅ Slide titles convey key takeaway (not generic like "The Problem")
- ✅ Important information at top of slide
- ✅ Good use of whitespace
- ❌ Cluttered slides with multiple ideas
- ❌ Text-heavy (100+ words per slide)
- ❌ Generic titles that don't communicate message

**Obvious:**
- ✅ Charts understandable at first glance
- ✅ Clear labels and legends
- ✅ Visual hierarchy guides the eye
- ✅ Key points immediately visible
- ❌ Confusing or unclear charts
- ❌ Too much data on one chart
- ❌ Reader has to search for key information

**Consistent & Professional:**
- ✅ Consistent color palette
- ✅ Consistent text sizing and formatting
- ✅ Consistent logo placement
- ✅ Page numbers (bottom right recommended)
- ✅ Professional appearance overall
- ❌ Inconsistent fonts, colors, or formatting

- ✅ Professional language throughout
- ✅ Consistent terminology
- ✅ No math errors in charts/numbers
- ❌ Typos or spelling errors

## 6. Deck Length (2%)

### Scoring Formula

| Slide Count | Score | Rationale |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| 10-20 slides | 10 | Ideal range |
| 8-9 slides | 8-9 | Slightly too concise; likely missing content |
| 21-25 slides | 7-8 | Slightly long |
| 26-30 slides | 5-7 | Too long; attention span issues |
| 31+ slides | 2-5 | Way too long |
| <8 slides | 4-6 | Missing critical content |

---

## Deck Score Calculation

```
Deck Score = (Content Clarity × 0.35) + (Structure × 0.28) + (Storytelling × 0.20) + (Design × 0.10) + (Spelling × 0.05) + (Length × 0.02)
```

---

## First Impression Analysis (Slides 1-3)

Investors decide in the first 3 minutes whether to continue or pass.

**Evaluate:**
- Does slide 1 or 2 clearly state what the company does?
- Do slides 1-3 create urgency and interest?
- Is the problem/solution immediately clear?
- Are there any immediate red flags?

**Output:**
- Verdict: CONTINUE or PASS
- Reasoning: Why investor would continue or pass

---

## Score Capping Rules

| If missing from deck... | Category | Cap at |
|-------------------------|----------|--------|
| Title slide with company description | Content Clarity | 6 |
| Problem slide | Content Clarity | 5 |
| Solution slide | Content Clarity | 5 |
| Ask slide | Structure | 6 |
| Two or more essential slide types for the stage | Overall Deck Score | 5 |

## Critical Accuracy Requirements

- ONLY flag something as "missing" if genuinely absent from deck
- VERIFY before stating timelines, metrics, or details are missing
- Ground ALL criticism in what is actually missing, not what could be better
- Be direct and honest, but factually accurate
