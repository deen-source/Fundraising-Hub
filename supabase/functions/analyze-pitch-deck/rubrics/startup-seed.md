## Team (20%)

### Founder-Market Fit & Insight (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do the founders have deep experience with this problem, buyer, or industry?
- Do they hold a non-obvious insight that shapes how the market should work?
- Do they have a credible right to win?
- Are customers, partners, or hires willing to bet on them?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No clear link to the market or problem. Insight isn't differentiated; feels generic or second-hand. No clear "why them." Hard to see why customers or senior hires would take them seriously. | Some relevant domain experience (worked in adjacent roles, limited time in the domain). Insight is plausible but not clearly differentiated or unique, or sharper than other players in the space. Early customers and hires are credible but mostly opportunistic (friends, network). | Strong domain depth or lived pain (ex-operator in the space, regulator, or clear insider). Non-obvious, high-conviction insight about market, workflow, or customer reflected in product, GTM, and roadmap. Strong external validation: recognisable customers, repeat/back-channel praise, or a strong group of early hires/advisors. Clear "why them." |

### Complementary Skills & Technical Depth (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can this team build, scale, and sell the product they have in market?
- Is there a credible balance across product, technical/operational, and commercial?
- Is there at least one builder who owns the technical or product roadmap end-to-end?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No clear commercial or GTM lead; sales and BD are an afterthought. No true technical owner; heavy reliance on agencies/contractors or junior staff. Overlapping skill sets; critical gaps unacknowledged. | One strong technical or commercial lead but clear gaps in the other dimension. Complementary skills present but unclear role clarity; gaps not explicitly acknowledged or planned for. | Clear complementarity across technical, product, and commercial. At least one founder with strong technical depth who can ship v1+2 and lead the technical roadmap. Evidence of shipping complex products or owning critical systems previously. Early hiring and org design plans make sense for the next 12-24 months. |

### Execution, Hiring & Learning Velocity (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Are they executing and hiring at a pace that matches Seed stage?
- How quickly do they push data and feedback into product/GTM changes?
- Do they show discipline in what they don't do?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Slow iteration; milestones missed or frequently redefined. Hiring stalled or reactive; org changes driven by chaos not learning. Few concrete "we tried X, learned Y and changed Z" examples. | A few good hires, a few gaps; still filling key roles. Roadmap and past product evolution in the deck show a few clear "we tried X, learned Y and changed Z" cycles, but not yet a consistent system. | Rapid iteration visible (at least monthly) with concrete learnings driving product and GTM changes. Clear demonstration of attracting A-players; strong candidates and advisors leaning in. Priorities and execution feel balanced and focused; this team clearly knows how to scale from here. Timeline shows meaningful product and GTM progress over the last 6–18 months (not just big vision). |

## Market & Insight (21%)

### Problem Severity & Urgency (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- How painful is the problem for the target customer?
- Is it a "must-fix" problem with real budget and willingness to pay, or a "nice-to-have"?
- How frequently does the problem occur?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Pain still sounds "nice-to-have"; it is at best optional. Usage/retention suggests low urgency when the novelty wears off. | Problem is important but not yet mission-critical; budget exists in some segments. Customers appreciate the solution but can live without it. Retention and customer anecdotes indicate willingness to pay but timing is not urgent. | Acute pain that materially impacts revenue, cost, risk, or compliance. Customers actively seeking alternatives; existing solutions clearly inadequate. Sales feedback and usage/retention patterns are consistent with high urgency. |

### Market Size & Expansion Potential (7%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Could this become category-defining in its space?
- How expandable is the initial wedge into adjacencies and new segments?
- Is there a credible path to a multi-billion-dollar opportunity?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| TAM likely constrained to a small vertical or geography with limited expansion paths or the claimed TAM is not supported by credible bottom-up logic. Product looks like a feature, not a platform, and no credible thesis for expanding into adjacent workflows, segments, or products. Very narrow niche with limited expansion paths; likely <$1B realistic TAM. | Reasonable wedge in a $1-5B space, with some plausible adjacencies. Still unclear whether this can support a long-term platform or is a point solution. | Category-defining potential. Strong "land and expand" motion articulated and partially validated by customer migrations. TAM framing combines top-down and bottom-up, with assumptions spelled out. Clear path to $5B+ opportunity when including adjacencies and expansion across verticals/geos. |

### Timing, Macro & Platform Tailwinds (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why is now the right moment for this company and category?
- Are there regulatory, platform, or behavioural shifts that favour this company?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No compelling "why now"; could have been built 5 years ago. Adoption might be slow or gated by dependencies outside founder control. | Some relevant tailwinds (regulatory, technology, behavioural) but mixed signals. Timing advantage not clearly articulated. | Strong "why now" thesis: clear tech, regulatory, or macro inflection that unlocks this opportunity now. Customers actively experimenting or budget newly available. |

### Competitive Landscape & Wedge (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Who else is solving this problem (startups, incumbents, in-house tools)?
- Is the market crowded, and if so, what is their wedge?
- Why will this team win against existing and new alternatives?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Enters a crowded space with no clear wedge or angle. Pitch is easily confused with existing tools; differentiation is marketing-level only. | Some differentiation (vertical focus, UX, use case) but others are close. Wedge is plausible but fragile; incumbents could copy without much friction. | Sharp, defensible wedge (underserved subsegment, unique workflow, privileged data). Clear articulation of why incumbents or generalist solutions can't or won't follow. Wedge validated by customer adoption and competitive wins. |

---

## Product & Tech (24%)

### Product-Workflow Fit & Solution Quality (6%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does the product integrate into real workflows and systems?
- Is there workflow integration that creates switching costs?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Feels like a productised demo; unclear daily or weekly use case. Adoption concentrated in one champion or team, not multiple users or teams. Some integration and light switching costs (data, set-up), but not yet "hard to rip out." | Some real workflow integration; product improves productivity but could be optional. UX is primitive or rough around the edges but usable. Some integration and light switching costs (data, set-up), but not yet "hard to rip out." | Product is embedded in a critical workflow; integrated with existing systems (CRM, ERP, core tools). Clear daily/weekly usage pattern; users would notice quickly if it disappeared. Switching would be painful (data migration, process change, habit disruption). Early guardrails and evaluation metrics in place. |

### Defensibility & Moat (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there a credible path to a durable competitive advantage?
- What could be the source—proprietary data/IP, network effects, integrations, vertical workflow depth, brand, or switching costs?
- Will usage generate compounding advantages over time?
- Is this a "thin wrapper" or the start of a real moat?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No credible path to structural advantage; differentiation is speed or execution only. Product could be rebuilt by a competent team in 6-12 months. No proprietary data, network effects, or meaningful switching costs. Looks like a pure wrapper or feature that an incumbent could ship quickly. | Some proprietary elements emerging: early data advantage, custom integrations, workflow depth, or nascent community/network. Early signs of a flywheel but not yet clearly compounding. Advantage is real but narrow or fragile; a well-funded competitor or incumbent could catch up with focus. Credible plan to widen the moat. | Clear moat emerging through one or more structural advantages: proprietary data/IP, network effects, deep workflow integration, vertical depth, or brand. Usage pattern naturally increases the advantage over time. Switching costs are forming; replication would require significant time and investment. Clear rights to use and improve key assets over time. |

### Technical Architecture, Scalability & Platform Risk (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the infra ready to support 10-50x growth?
- Are they overly dependent on a single vendor or platform?
- Is there a credible technical roadmap?
- Are key technical risks acknowledged and mitigated?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Fragile infra; outages or performance issues already limiting growth. Single critical dependency (cloud, model, marketplace, API) with no mitigation. No clear technical roadmap; big risks unacknowledged. | Some platform flexibility; differentiation exists beyond base dependencies. Manageable cost structure. Technical risks acknowledged with reasonable mitigation approach. | Architecture designed for scale, reliability, and cost control. Evidence of managing platform risk (e.g., multi-provider strategy, abstraction layers, ability to switch or degrade gracefully). Clear technical roadmap with data supporting strong economics at scale (latency, reliability, and unit cost). |

### Product Maturity & Stickiness (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- How mature is the product for Seed? Is usage consistent and growing?
- Do customers rely on it regularly? Would they notice if it disappeared?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Product feels like an early MVP; many manual processes behind the scenes. Low or inconsistent usage. Users could easily stop using without impact to their workflow. | Limited but growing usage with some regular patterns. Product still manual behind the scenes but improving. Some users engaged but not yet habitual. | Active, engaged usage with clear patterns indicating product is embedded in user behaviour. Users would notice quickly if product disappeared. By model: SaaS—healthy DAU/WAU ratios, clear daily/weekly usage patterns. Marketplace—repeat transactions, increasing activity per user. E-commerce—repeat purchase behaviour, returning customers. Fintech—transaction frequency stable or increasing. B2C—session frequency and engagement depth healthy. |

---

## Traction & GTM (20%)

### Traction & Retention Signals (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- What hard evidence exists that customers value and pay for this?
- Is the customer base retaining and expanding? Is growth durable?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Little or no revenue; mostly pilots, trials, or LOIs with weak commitment. Limited data on cohort behaviour. Growth happening but not yet consistent. No insight into whether customers stay or expand. High churn or not measured. | Revenue building but small relative to time in market. Some customers returning but limited data on cohort behaviour. Growth happening but not yet consistent. Some expansion occurring but not yet systematic. Pipeline building but conversion uncertain. Moderate customer concentration. | Strong revenue or usage scale for the stage with customers across multiple accounts. Retention and expansion strong relative to category norms. Growth is consistent and durable, not lumpy or one-off. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—$50-150k+ ARR, 10-20+ customers, >85% gross retention, 10-20% MoM growth. Marketplace—$500k+ GMV, meaningful take rate, cohort retention >50% at M6; liquidity improving. Fintech—$1M+ TPV or 1k+ transacting users. Usage-based—strong consumption growth (15%+ MoM), logo retention >80%, expansion visible. B2C—5-10k+ engaged users, D30 retention >20%, early monetisation or clear path. |

### GTM Motion & Distribution Strategy (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do they know how to find, acquire, and retain customers at this stage?
- Is this the beginning of a repeatable, scalable GTM motion?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Sales are ad hoc and entirely founder-led with no pattern. No clear target customer, channels or opportunity. No credible acquisition channel or hypothesis. Relying on 'build it and they will come' or vague virality assumptions. | Defined target customer and early channels identified (outbound, PLG, partners, etc). Some repeatability in getting meetings or sign-ups, but conversion not yet consistent. GTM motion (PLG vs founder-led vs channel) is plausible but early. | Repeatable motion emerging: clear playbook from top-of-funnel to closed. Early inbound or referral-driven growth. Pipeline visibility with improving conversion. Path to scaling beyond founder-led sales is credible. For PLG/B2C motion, early signs of organic growth (cohorts, invite loops, word-of-mouth). ICP and buyer profile are sharp; they know exactly who they win with. |

---

## Business & Fundability (15%)

### Capital Efficiency & Runway Plan (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can they reach a credible Series A bar with this round?
- Do they have a clear plan of what to prove with this capital?
- Use of funds

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| High burn expectations with late revenue; runway short relative to plan. Use of funds vague. Hiring and plan profile misaligned with stage and economics. | Some sense of milestones (product + traction + hires) but not sharply defined. Some cushion. Reasonable runway plan but fuzzy on trade-offs and prioritisation. Round size is roughly appropriate for plan, but trade-offs and reduction scenarios are not clearly thought through. | Crisp 12-18 month milestone plan for this round (product, data, GTM, team). Lean, focused use of capital; clear understanding of what needs to be true for Series A. Milestones are outcome-based, not activity-based. |

### Unit Economics (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Are gross margins healthy for the category?
- Is there early line of sight to sensible customer acquisition cost, payback period, and lifetime value?
- Is there a path to operating leverage?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Gross margins poor for category with no clear path to improvement. Customer acquisition costs not tracked or clearly unsustainable. Heavy services component with no credible route to leverage. Value created but not captured. | Gross margins in acceptable range for category; improving with scale expected. Customer economics early or noisy, path to healthy economics plausible but unproven. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—50-70% gross margin. Marketplace—40-60% on net revenue. Fintech—20-40% (varies by product). Usage-based/Infra—40-60%. E-commerce—30-50% (depends on fulfilment). | Healthy gross margin for category. Customer economics showing positive trajectory (efficient acquisition, reasonable payback, strong lifetime value relative to acquisition cost). Clear operating leverage emerging as company scales. Benchmarks by model: SaaS—>75% gross margin, CAC payback <18 months, LTV/CAC >3x. Marketplace—>65% on net revenue. Fintech—>50% or net revenue, improving take rate. Fintech—>40%+ (or justified lower with volume leverage). Usage-based/Infra—>65%. E-commerce—>55% (or clear path with scale). |

### Fundability & Series A Path (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- If they execute their plan, will Series A investors be excited?
- Are there clear metrics and proof points that de-risk the big questions?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No coherent story of what an A-ready company looks like for this business; unclear what changes between now and Series A. Milestones either unrealistic or too weak to justify a large round. No comparable precedents or milestones mismatched to stage. | Some sense of A-round comparables; rough sense of what Series A investors need to see. Story is plausible but not crisp; some key risks still unresolved. | Clear validation milestones and crisp narrative: "If we hit X, Y, Z, a quality Series A fund will lean in." Named realistic comparables; strong understanding of current Series A bar in this category. Clear path to metrics and proof points that Series A investors in this category expect. |

### Thesis Fit (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is this AI-First (not traditional SaaS with AI layered on)?
- Is this B2B/Enterprise in our core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure)?
- Does it have global scale potential?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Weak fit: B2C, non-AI-native, or outside core sectors. No clear path to global scale. | Partial fit: B2B but not clearly AI-first, or AI-native but outside core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure). Could still be worth it for exceptional team and traction, but not a natural fit for Arconic's value-add. | Strong fit: AI-First B2B/Enterprise in core sectors (Fintech, Commerce, Banking, AI, Software & Enterprise Tech, Data Infrastructure). Vertical focus with global expansion potential. Arconic's network (banks, telcos, retailers) and AI expertise directly relevant to scaling this company. |

## Category Score Calculation

For each category, calculate the weighted average of its criteria, then normalize to a 0-10 scale:

```
Category Score = Σ(criterion score × criterion weight) ÷ category total weight
```

**Example for Team (20% total):**
- Founder-Market Fit (10%): scores 7
- Complementary Skills (5%): scores 6
- Execution & Learning (5%): scores 8

Category weighted sum: (7 × 0.10) + (6 × 0.05) + (8 × 0.05) = 1.40
Team Score: 1.40 ÷ 0.20 = **7.0 out of 10**

---

## Overall Startup Score Calculation

```
Overall Score = Σ(criterion score × criterion weight)
```

This produces a score out of 10.
