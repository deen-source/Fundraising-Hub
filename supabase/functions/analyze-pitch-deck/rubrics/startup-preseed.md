## Team (28%)

### Founder-Market Fit & Insight (12%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do the founders have lived experience with this problem or buyer?
- Do they hold a non-obvious insight that changes how this market should work?
- Do they have an unfair advantage in this problem?
- Are they credible in the eyes of the customers they're targeting?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No clear link to the market or problem. Insight feels generic or second-hand. No articulated "why us." Can't clearly articulate why incumbents haven't solved this already. | Some relevant experience (worked in adjacent roles, or limited time in the domain). Insight is plausible but not clearly differentiated or unique. Some customer empathy evident but shallow articulation of workflows and pain points. | Strong domain depth or lived pain (ex-operator in the space, regulator, or clear insider). Non-obvious, high-conviction insight about the market, workflow, or customer. Customers and/or relevant peers/investors would recognise them as credible. Clear "why them." |

### Complementary Skills & Technical Depth (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can this team actually build and sell the product they're describing?
- Is there a credible balance across product, technical/operational, and commercial/growth?
- Is there at least one builder who can own the technical or product roadmap end-to-end?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No one with clear commercial or GTM instincts. No true technical owner; heavy reliance on agencies/contractors. Overlapping skill sets; critical gaps unacknowledged. | One strong technical or commercial lead but clear gaps in the other dimension. Complementary skills present but unclear role clarity; gaps are not explicitly acknowledged or planned for. | At least one founder with strong technical depth who can ship v1 alone. Clear complementarity across technical, product, and commercial. Evidence of shipping complex products or owning critical systems in prior roles and a clear view of who they need to hire next to round out the team. |

### Ambition, Ownership & Learning Velocity (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there evidence of bold vision and rapid iteration?
- How quickly do they test, learn, and adjust?
- Is the vision appropriately ambitious for a venture-scale outcome?
- Do they demonstrate discipline in what they don't do?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Slow iteration implied; long gaps between milestones. Vision is fuzzy or framed in buzzwords. Building in isolation with no evidence of customer contact. No clear timeline of product or company evolution; deck reads like a static idea rather than an evolving plan. | Some experiments and learning referenced but not systematic. Vision is big but not yet grounded in a defensible plan. Timeline, pivots, or product evolution are mentioned but unclear. | Rapid iteration loops (weekly or at least monthly) with concrete learnings and visible product/GTM changes. Strong bias to action; takes responsibility for failures. Clear, ambitious vision that could credibly produce a large, independent company. Deck highlights specific decisions or pivots based on customer or data feedback. |

## Market & Insight (28%)

### Problem Severity & Urgency (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- How painful is the problem for the target customer?
- Is it a "must-fix" problem with real budget and willingness to pay, or a "nice-to-have"?
- How frequently does the problem occur?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Pain is vague, optional, or clearly non-urgent. Hard to see a clear budget line or economic buyer. Problem is infrequent or peripheral to core workflows. | Problem is real and annoying, with some apparent budget. Customers acknowledge the issue but can live with current workarounds. Frequency is moderate; benefits are somewhat compelling but not burning. | Acute pain that materially impacts revenue, cost, risk, or compliance. Existing solutions are clearly inadequate; customers actively seeking alternatives. Clear budget owners and strong willingness to pay to solve it. |

### Market Size & Expansion Potential (10%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there a credible path to a large revenue opportunity?
- Is there an initial wedge with plausible expansion paths; can they expand beyond the initial wedge into adjacent workflows, segments, or products?
- Could this be a category-defining company?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Very narrow niche with limited expansion paths; likely <$1B realistic TAM. Product looks like a feature, not a platform, and no credible thesis for expanding into adjacent workflows, segments, or products. | Reasonable wedge in a $1-5B space, with some plausible adjacencies. Still unclear whether this can support a long-term platform or is a point solution. | Thoughtful explanation of how the wedge expands into a broader system of record or system of intelligence. Clear path to $5B+ opportunity when including adjacencies and expansion across verticals/geos. |

### Timing, Macro & Platform Tailwinds (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why is now the right moment for this company?
- Are there regulatory, platform, or behavioural shifts that favour this company?
- Who else is solving this problem (startups, incumbents, in-house tools)?
- Is the market crowded, and if so, what is their wedge?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No compelling timing story; could have been built 5 years ago. Adoption might be slow or gated by dependencies outside founder control. | Some relevant tailwinds (regulatory, technology, behavioural) but mixed signals. Timing advantage not clearly articulated. | Strong "why now" thesis: clear tech, regulatory, or macro inflection that unlocks this opportunity now. Customers actively experimenting or budget newly available. |

### Competitive Landscape & Wedge (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the market crowded, and if so, what is their wedge?
- Can they realistically win the segment they're targeting?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Enters a crowded space with no clear wedge or angle. Pitch is easily confused with existing tools; differentiation is marketing-level only. | Some differentiation (vertical focus, UX, use case) but others are close. Wedge is plausible but fragile; incumbents could copy without much friction. | Sharp, defensible wedge (underserved subsegment, unique workflow, privileged data). Clear articulation of why incumbents or generalist solutions can't or won't follow. |

---

## Product & Tech (24%)

### Product-Workflow Fit & Solution Quality (7%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does the product integrate into real workflows and systems?
- Is there workflow integration that creates switching costs?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Feels like a productised demo; unclear daily or weekly use case. Adoption concentrated in one champion or team, not multiple users or teams. Product integrated only with light touchpoints. | Some real workflow integration; product improves productivity but could be optional. UX is primitive or rough around the edges but usable. Early thought given to quality and evaluation but limited frameworks. | Product is embedded in a critical workflow; integrated with existing systems (CRM, ERP, core tools). Clear daily/weekly usage pattern. Early guardrails and evaluation metrics in place; clear strategy for edge cases and quality assurance. |

### Defensibility & Moat (8%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there a credible path to a durable competitive advantage?
- What could be the source—proprietary data/IP, network effects, integrations, vertical workflow depth, brand, or switching costs?
- Will usage generate compounding advantages over time?
- Is this a "thin wrapper" or the start of a real moat?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No credible path to structural advantage; differentiation is speed or execution only. Product could be rebuilt by a competent team in 6-12 months. No proprietary data, network effects, or meaningful switching costs. Looks like a pure wrapper or feature that an incumbent could ship quickly. | Some proprietary elements emerging: early data advantage, custom integrations, workflow depth, or nascent community/network. Early signs of a flywheel but not yet clearly compounding. Advantage is real but narrow or fragile; a well-funded competitor or incumbent could catch up with focus. | Clear path to durable moat through one or more structural advantages: proprietary data/IP, network effects, deep workflow integration, vertical depth, or emerging brand. Usage pattern naturally increases the advantage over time. Switching costs are forming; replication would require significant time and investment. Clear rights to use and improve key assets over time. |

### Technical Architecture & Platform Risk (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the technical approach sound with manageable platform dependencies?
- Are key technical risks acknowledged?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Single critical dependency with existential risk. High sensitivity to third-party pricing or API changes. Obvious technical risks unacknowledged. | Some platform flexibility; differentiation exists beyond base dependencies. Manageable cost structure. Technical risks acknowledged with reasonable mitigation approach. | Architecture designed for flexibility and scale. Value clearly in application layer, not dependent on a single vendor. Costs and latency consistent at a conceptual level. Explicit plan for managing platform risk (e.g., multi-provider strategy, abstraction layers). |

### Stage & Readiness (4%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- What is actually built and in use today?
- Is there something demoable/usable by real users?
- Is the pace of shipping aligned with the time spent?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Idea-stage only; slides and vague prototypes with no working demo. Long time spent already with little to show. | MVP or alpha in place; some users/testers but not yet robust. Product still manual behind the scenes, but learning is happening. | Working alpha/beta; real users using it in their workflow, even if small numbers. Clear roadmap to production readiness within 6-12 months; team is shipping rapidly. |

---

## Traction & Learning (12%)

### Hypothesis Validation & Customer Engagement (7%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- What evidence exists beyond anecdotes?
- What proof exists that customers want this and will pay?
- Are they validating the right hypotheses for this stage?
- How deep are current customer conversations?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Only problem interviews with no structured learnings. Founder assumptions only; no external validation. Conversations scattered and generic; unclear if talking to the right customers. | LOIs, pilots, or waitlists from somewhat qualified ICPs. Some structured learnings on problem, willingness to pay, or behaviour. Design partners engaged but not yet paying. | Paying pilots, contracted users, or design partners with skin in the game. Strong revenue signals relative to time since launch or strong engagement/usage signals with a clear plan for monetisation. Clear articulation of what they've learned, what was invalidated, and how approach has evolved. |

### GTM Motion & Early Funnel Signals (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do they know who they are selling to, how, and why that motion fits the product/market?
- Is there early pipeline or repeatability emerging?
- Is there a clear path to their first 10 paying customers?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| No clear target customer. No credible acquisition channel or hypothesis. Relying on 'build it and they will come' or vague virality assumptions. | GTM approach is plausible but untested. Some early acquisition signals but channel not yet repeatable. For B2B: founder-led sales working but not scalable. For B2C/e-commerce: acquisition channels identified with early CAC signals; conversion funnel showing promise. For PLG: self-serve funnel with activation metrics, organic or referral growth visible. | Evidence of repeatable acquisition emerging. Early sense of how customers move from awareness to activation. For B2B: clear playbook; founder can sell, pipeline building. For B2C/e-commerce: acquisition channels identified with early CAC signals; conversion funnel showing promise. For PLG: self-serve funnel with activation metrics, organic or referral growth visible. |

## Business & Fundability (8%)

### Capital Efficiency & Milestone Plan (5%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can they reach compelling seed milestones with this raise?
- Do they have a clear plan of what to prove with this round?
- Is use of funds clear and focused?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| High burn expectations; vague idea of milestones ("build product, hire sales"). Vague use of funds. Runway and hiring plan misaligned with pre-seed realities. Milestones described in terms of activities ("hire X, build Y") rather than outcomes ("prove Z about customers / revenue / product"). | Some sense of milestones (product + traction + hires) but not sharply defined. Some cushion. Reasonable runway plan but fuzzy on trade-offs and prioritisation. Round size is roughly appropriate for plan, but trade-offs and reduction scenarios are not clearly thought through. | Crisp 12-18 month milestone plan for this round (product, data, GTM, team). Lean, focused use of capital; clear understanding of what needs to be true for seed. |

### Next Round Narrative & Fundability (3%)

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there a clear story that a seed investor could underwrite?
- Are there obvious milestones and proof points that de-risk the big questions?

| Low (0-3) | Medium (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Unclear what success looks like. No coherent next-round story; unclear what changes between now and seed. No comparable precedents or milestones mismatched to stage. | Some comparables, rough sense of what seed investors need to see. Story is plausible but not crisp. Some risk on execution. Adjacent to typical seed profiles. | Clear validation milestones. Compelling narrative: "If we hit X, Y, Z, a quality seed fund will lean in." Named realistic comparables; strong understanding of the seed bar in this category. |

## Category Score Calculation

For each category, calculate the weighted average of its criteria, then normalize to a 0-10 scale:

```
Category Score = Σ(criterion score × criterion weight) ÷ category total weight
```

**Example for Team (28% total):**
- Founder-Market Fit (12%): scores 7
- Complementary Skills (8%): scores 6
- Ambition & Learning (8%): scores 8

Category weighted sum: (7 × 0.12) + (6 × 0.08) + (8 × 0.08) = 1.96
Team Score: 1.96 ÷ 0.28 = **7.0 out of 10**

---

## Overall Startup Score Calculation

```
Overall Score = Σ(criterion score × criterion weight)
```

This produces a score out of 10.
